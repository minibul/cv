### **ABOUT:**
---------------------------
For more than 10 years I have been working in Moscow restaurants as a sous chef. In 2019, I wanted to expand my horizons, signed up for a course on the basics of the python language. After that I took introductory courses in data analysis and software testing (the last one hooked me the most). I read Savin's book, watched a huge number of videos on the topic of QA and realized that I want to grow in this.

* In the second half of 2020, I signed up for the Yandex.Practicum course ["Test Engineer"](https://practicum.yandex.ru/qa-engineer/), completed it, got a job at HICE Bank and now I am developing in testing.
* February 2022 I was a listener of the [Podlodka](https://podlodka.io/) QA Crew conference.
* July 2022 I was a listener of the [Podlodka](https://podlodka.io/) SoftSkills Crew conference.
* In July 2022 successfully passed the selection to the [Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.ru/qa-engineer/) educational project for the role of "Project Reviewer" of the course "Test Engineer".
* August 2022 I started the course - English B1 level in [NH mācību centrs](https://www.nh.lv/), Riga.
* August 2022 I was a listener of the [Podlodka](https://podlodka.io/) QA Crew conference.
* November 2022 I was a listener of the [Podlodka](https://podlodka.io/) Teamlead Crew conference.

In general, I value working with people who respect themselves, their time, and those around them and appreciate order and accuracy, but most importantly, are always eager to learn and develop.

I love to travel, although I have only been to 18 countries so far. Favorite transport is a bicycle.

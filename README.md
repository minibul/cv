### **ABOUT:**

---------------------------
For more than 10 years I have been working in Moscow restaurants as a sous chef. In 2019, I wanted to expand my horizons, signed up for a course on the basics of the python language. After that I took introductory courses in data analysis and software testing (the last one hooked me the most). I read Savin's book, watched a huge number of videos on the topic of QA and realized that I want to grow in this.

In general, I value working with people who respect themselves, their time, and those around them and appreciate order and accuracy, but most importantly, are always eager to learn and develop.

I love to travel, although I have only been to 18 countries so far. Favorite transport is a bicycle.

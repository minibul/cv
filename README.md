### ABOUT:

---------------------------
For more than 10 years I have been working in Moscow restaurants as a sous chef. In 2019, I wanted to expand my horizons and signed up for a course on the basics of Python. After that, I took introductory courses in data analysis and software testing (the last one hooked me the most). I read Savin's book, watched a huge number of videos on the topic of QA, and realized that I want to grow in this. I value working with people who respect themselves, their time, and those around them and appreciate order and accuracy, but most importantly, are always eager to learn and develop. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and cycling. I've visited 18 countries so far and look forward to exploring more.

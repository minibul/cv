### **ABOUT:**
---------------------------
For more than 10 years I have been working in Moscow restaurants as a sous chef. In 2019, I wanted to expand my horizons, signed up for a course on the basics of the python language. After that I took introductory courses in data analysis and software testing (the last one hooked me the most). I read Savin's book, watched a huge number of videos on the topic of QA and realized that I want to grow in this.

* In the second half of 2020, I signed up for the Yandex.Practicum course "Test Engineer", completed it, got a job at HICE Bank and now I am developing in testing
* February 2022 I was a listener of the Podlodka QA Crew conference
* May 2022 I started the course - Java Test Automation in Yandex.Practicum
* July 2022 I was a listener of the Podlodka SoftSkills Crew conference
* In July 2022 successfully passed the selection to the Yandex educational project for the role of "Project Reviewer" of the course "Test Engineer"
* August 2022 I started the course - English B1 level in NH mācību centrs, Riga
* August 2022 I was a listener of the Podlodka QA Crew conference

In general, it is important for me to work with people who respect themselves, their time and those around them, appreciate order and accuracy, and most importantly, constantly develop.

I love to travel, although I have only been to 18 countries so far. Favorite transport is a bicycle.
